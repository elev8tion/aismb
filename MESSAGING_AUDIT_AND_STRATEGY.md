## 🔴 CURRENT MESSAGING PROBLEMS

### 1. **Hero Section** (components/HeroSection.tsx)
**Current**: "Get 30% of your time back in 30 days"
- Focus: Time savings, efficiency
- Positioning: Service provider ("We handle the implementation")
- Implication: Hands-off, outsourced solution

❌ **Issues**:
- "No tech skills needed" implies SMBs are passive recipients
- "We handle the implementation" removes agency and learning
- Focuses on outcomes, not capability building
- Doesn't mention agentic systems, creative partnership, or empowerment

---

### 2. **Problem Section** (components/ProblemSection.tsx)
**Current Pain Points**:
- Drowning in manual tasks
- Missing after-hours calls
- Slow proposal turnaround
- Inconsistent cash flow

✅ **What's Good**: Real operational challenges
❌ **What's Missing**:
- No mention of lack of AI knowledge/capability
- Doesn't address fear of being left behind in AI revolution
- Doesn't speak to desire to LEARN and BUILD, not just BUY
- Misses the "I want to understand this" mindset

---

### 3. **How It Works** (components/HowItWorksSection.tsx)
**Current Process**:
1. Discovery: "WE audit YOUR workflows"
2. Build: "WE design, build, and test"
3. Launch: "WE train your team"

❌ **Critical Issues**:
- 100% passive language - everything is done TO them, not WITH them
- No collaborative building
- "Train your team" is last step, not integrated throughout
- No mention of teaching agentic systems concepts
- No emphasis on SMB becoming capable/independent

---

### 4. **Use Cases** (components/UseCaseSelector.tsx)
**Current**: Industry-specific workflows
- HVAC intake & scheduling
- Plumbing emergency dispatch
- Property management tenant requests
- Construction bid management

❌ **Issues**:
- Too narrow - focuses on specific tasks, not systems thinking
- Doesn't showcase agentic system concepts
- No educational component
- Implies: "We build this specific thing for you" vs "You learn to build agentic systems"

---

### 5. **Pricing** (components/PricingSection.tsx)
**Current Tiers**:
- Turn On AI: $12K setup + $4K/month
- Ops Copilot: $32K setup + $9K/month
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

❌ **Issues**:
- Pure service pricing (setup + monthly retainer)
- Doesn't reflect partnership/education model
- No clear learning deliverables
- Implies ongoing dependency, not capability transfer
