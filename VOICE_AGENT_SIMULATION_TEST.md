Most custom software has some way to connect, and we'll find what works for you."

   - How much detail to give (some responses longer than others)
   - When to add examples vs stay concise

---

## TTS PRONUNCIATION CONCERNS TO TEST

**Numbers:**
- ✅ "Four thousand" - should be fine
- ⚠️ "Ninety-five hundred" - verify vs "nine thousand five hundred"
- ✅ "Thirty thousand" - should be fine
- ⚠️ "Twenty-four-seven" - verify hyphenation
- ⚠️ "One-fifty to three hundred percent" - may sound awkward

**Acronyms:**
- ⚠️ "AWS or Azure" - verify pronunciation
- ⚠️ "SMS" - verify (S-M-S vs "text messages")
- ⚠️ "API" - verify (A-P-I vs "application interface")

**Industry Terms:**
- ✅ "Agentic systems" - should be fine
- ✅ "ChatGPT" - commonly known, should pronounce correctly
- ⚠️ "ROI" - verify (R-O-I vs "return on investment")

**Recommendation:** Test actual TTS output with voice agent for these edge cases.
